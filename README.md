# The-Tasting-Tracks
Project Name: The Tasting Tracks
Role: Front-End Developer
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, Images

Description:
The Tasting Tracks is a visually engaging food and recipe website designed to offer users a rich and flavorful browsing experience. As part of this project, I created multiple static web pages to showcase different meal categories such as breakfast, snacks, and salads, accompanied by vibrant food imagery. Each page was designed with user experience in mind, combining appealing layouts with clear navigation and descriptive content.

The website includes sections like an About page and a blog page, offering both culinary insights and recipe details. I handled the layout structure using HTML and styled the visual elements with CSS to ensure responsiveness and a clean design. This project helped me sharpen my front-end development skills, improve visual design sense, and understand the importance of content organization in a real-world website.
